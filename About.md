`random.parts` is a personal project of growth and reflection. A collection of notes from the random parts of my day to day learning. The idea was hatched after I finished reading _[Mindset](https://www.overdrive.com/media/74637/mindset)_, by Carol Dweck.

Recognizing how to use a growth mindset to reframe a deeply entrenched [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), I started taking [notes](http://happenapps.com/#quiver "Quiver: The Programmer's Notebook") on the random happenings I came across. Both as a reference and as a visual progress log, but also with the intent to _[Show Your Work!](https://www.overdrive.com/media/1555257/show-your-work)_. The tech notes would later be refined and given direction by a [Hacker News post](<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902>) on [TILs (Today I Learned)](<https://github.com/thoughtbot/til>).

After months of intermittent refactoring, it all tied together while listening to part zero of _[The Icarus Deception](https://www.overdrive.com/media/1046990/the-icarus-deception)_. The whole point of this project was to grow, to step out of my comfort zone and to give back. A small act of gratitude. Gratitude for all of the people who have shared their words with me. Words of knowledge, inspiration, encouragement, insight and perspectives. Even words of resistance and criticism, as they have pointed me towards an understanding of where my reactions to such things are not in alignment with my truth. While this project may be a personal learning experiment, it is in it's own way, a product of all the people whose words and actions have impacted my journey.

>> Art always involves a collision with the marketplace, an interaction with a recipient, a gift given and a gift received. You can plan and sketch and curse the system all day, but if you don't ship _you haven't done your work_. . .it's entirely possible that one day, your insight will be discovered and that it will touch someone or make a difference. But if you hide your contribution from us, you can't be considered an artiest, because it is not art until a human connection is made.
