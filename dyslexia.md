This project is a small collection of my personal thoughts and experiences with Dyslexia. It will also touch on some aspects dealing with ADHD, as they are friends that often travel together.

I wanted to share my experience, as a way to `pay it forward`, to anyone who may stumble upon this in their search for understanding. Being judged as lazy, weird, facetious, ornery, obstinate, or a hard-headed slacker because one [does not fit] into the group-think version of `normal` is a lonely place to be. Once knowledge and understanding is found, a perspective change is possible in dissolving the fear, frustration, and unkindness that has followed us.

ADHD was and is not something many people believe is a [real way of functioning]. The most common understanding of it is patently false, thanks in part to [it's misleading name][1]. However, with all of the money pouring into it that is [slowly changing][2]. Dyslexia, on the other hand, has it worse; it is commonly misunderstood and the misguided information continues to circulate.

There are many sources about [dyslexia][3] that shed light on what it is and some that still believe it's only about writing and seeing letters backwards. Or worse, that we [can not read][4] at all. There are also many personal stories and accounts of how it has affected individual lives. These were the _most helpful_ for myself, as it has been comforting to know that the disappointment I have experienced from others is not singularly mine.

In reading these stories, dyslexia still felt `hidden` as it was hidden from myself for years. This project is an attempt to `show` at least one of the many sides of dyslexia through a combination of [git commits and diffs][5]. The jekyll plugin, [jekyll-versioned_files][6], was created specificity for this purpose.

The first version was written in a basic `vim` environment _without_ spell check. This way there would not be a red underline showing misspelled words or allow me the habit of right-clicking a word to get its spelling; many times my spelling is so far off it won't have spelling suggestions anyway. It's not a first draft, per se, I wanted it to have some sense of flow. Many missing word and suffix corrections were made out of habit on the 3rd or 4th read-though, before committing the first version. I made a honest attempt to spell every word correctly and fix any typos; when I made the spell corrected version I was genuinely proud of many of the words that I had spelled correctly in the first place - words that have taken a lot of time to finally get right. The first version may be quite painful to read. The highest numbered `Revision` will be the most recent currently corrected version.
