### About

This was a personal project of growth and reflection. I wasn't sure what to expect or what I would learn. Working on other people's software is easy; the thought of putting something, anything, out there that was my own, where others could see it all - that was terrifying. 

I've gone through life always being the 'other' - different; I would see things different, act different - this is not better or worse/good or bad, it just is - this is also not the way to build self-worth in public grade school. It wasn't until shortly before I started this project that I finally realized, and found out, I somehow got this far being on the higher end of the ADHD spectrum - one that came with a bunch of its friends, most notably, dyslexia. 

My next personal project will most likely be on dyslexia, as it is horribly misunderstood (as is the misnamed adhd). It is also something that this project allowed me to accept and not hide from. It was healing. This project was healing. The memories of the past where my self-expression and my creative work never good enough; the memories of shame and embarrassment, my thoughts and other peoples opinions, are just that - old thoughts, opinions and memories. That was the biggest lesson to come from this project, one I didnt even know I needed.

This project took one last turn, one that brought clarity on something I still struggle with. Knowing when to move on. I strive to be pragmatic and stoic in all things, the problem is my expectations, which really don't work well with stoicism and taoism practices. There is an undying streak of optimism and belief that I put into people and things around me, and some would view it as a positive thing; it's not so positive when the energy of that thing has moved on long ago and holding on to it any long only blocks your own progress. 

This project has been past it's time for a little over a year now. I wanted it to be more then it ended up being, thats why I held on, hoping the desire to work on it further would come around - instead, it showed me how to accept what it was, the need for me to free my head space, and mostly, to not allow my fear and stubbornness to get in the way of my passions, again.
